# Image processing for Automatic Vehicle Registration-



 <h3>   This project is to maintain the automatic registry of college buses arrival and departure timings using image processing .</h3>

 

 <h5>The project aims at designing a Number Plate Recognition (NPR) system which maintains the registry of college buses. 

 The USB camera is used which automatically captures the image of the number plate of the vehicles passing through the entrance gate in Real Time. 

 The number plate is detected using ANPR and OCR using OpenCV python, then the number is compared with the database of college bus. If the detected number is college bus then the based on the direction of bus whether arrival or departure is determined using image processing and the .csv file is maintained for the automatic data logger. </h5>
